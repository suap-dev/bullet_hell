// "The default timestep() is 64 hertz, or 15625 microseconds
// This value was chosen because using 60 hertz has the
// potential for a pathological interaction with the monitor
// refresh rate where the game alternates between running two
// fixed timesteps and zero fixed timesteps per frame (for
// example when running two fixed timesteps takes longer than
// a frame). Additionally, the value is a power of two which
// losslessly converts into f32 and f64.""
